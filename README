Cpc README
**********

CPC is a programming language designed for writing concurrent systems.

The CPC programmer manipulates cooperatively scheduled threads; the CPC
program is then processed by the CPC translator, which produces highly
efficient event-loop code. In the author's opinion, this approach gives
the best of the two worlds: the convenience of programming with threads,
and the low memory usage of event-loop code.

The semantics of CPC is defined as a source-to-source translation from
CPC into plain C using a technique known as conversion into Continuation
Passing Style.

Requirements:
-------------
    - autoconf
    - gcc (or another C compiler, but this is untested)
    - Ocaml >= 3.08 (or >= 3.10 if you want to compile using ocamlbuild)
    - (optional) Latex, to build the cpc manual (in doc directory)

Installation:
-------------
To build cpc, you juste have to run from the root directory:

    chmod u+x configure
    ./configure
    make
    make samples (optional)
    make install (optional, as root)

This will build the main executable, which is then copied to
bin/cpc.asm.exe. It also builds the cpc runtime (in runtime directory)
and a bunch of samples (in samples directory).

How to use:
-----------
You can either use bin/cpc.asm.exe directly in your Makefiles (see e.g.
samples/Makefile and runtime/Makefile) or use the bin/cpc wrapper:

    cd samples
    ../bin/cpc bug.cpc
    ./a.out
    head -n1 bug.cpc
    rm a.out

If you choose to install cpc, you should add:
    -I cpc
to your compile flags and:
    -lm -pthread -lcpcfull
to your link flags. You can replace -lcpcfull by -lcpc if you do not use
the functions defined in <cpc_lib.h>.

Options:
--------
bin/cpc.asm.exe has the following useful options:

--stage n           perform transformations up to stage n
--pause             step by step cps marking [*]
--tr cpc            print (a lot of) debug messages
--debug debug       include debug printf in the generated code
--out file          output file
--external-patch    cpc_patch from cpc_runtime.h instead of inlining it

and a gazillion useless ones, inherited from CIL, that you might
discover through bin/cpc.asm.exe --help. Using some of them might break
cpc completely, so use at your own risk!

[*] In step by step mode, here is what you can do at each step:
    d<Enter>    dump the current file
    q<Enter>    quit (saving the current file)
    r<Enter>    exit step by step mode
    <Enter>     perform another step

Known bugs and limitations:
---------------------------
cpc_detach and cpc_attach should come in pairs, otherwise cpc_mainloop()
might not return.

Moreover, cpc keywords are NOT supported in detached mode (except
cpc_attach, of course). Note that this includes cpc_spawn: you have to
re-attach in order to spawn a new cooperative thread.
    NB: there is an experimental support of cpc_spawn, cpc_yield,
    cpc_sleep and cpc_io_wait at the moment. It might be dropped so do
    not rely on it. Condition variables are still NOT supported.

Cpc relies on CIL, which makes a number of assumptions about
the underlying C machine and compiler. These assumptions are defined
when ./configure is executed. As a result:
- if you move on another machine/architecture/compiler, you should
  re-run ./configure.
- if you want to cross-compile, you must use the CIL_MACHINE environment
  variable. See src/machdepenv.ml for further details or ask the
  authors.

Please do not hesitate to report any bug at kerneis@pps.jussieu.fr.

The current version of cpc is built upon the CIL framework. Development
version in kept in sync with CIL svn, but some CIL features have been
disabled in cpc.  If you want more information about CIL, you'll find
the (automatically generated) documentation in doc/html. Also checkout:
http://manju.cs.berkeley.edu/cil/ for the original CIL.
