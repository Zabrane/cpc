Quick start
===========

sh configure

ocamlbuild cil.otarget \
    && cp _build/src/main.native obj/x86_LINUX/cilly.asm.exe
# Change x86_LINUX if needed.

# You can use 'make' instead of ocamlbuild but it's slower and
# less reliable.
# make install is NOT recommended

cd runtime && make
# make install is optional

cd ../samples && make
# make install doesn't exist

Read the .cpc files (and the Makefile) to see how it works.

Don't forget to re-run configure if you move the root directory.
