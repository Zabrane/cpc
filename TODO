[src/cil.ml]
* Check indentation in pStmtKind (for CPC constructs)
  => should be quite good already.
* Handle CPC constructs in computeCFGInfo (function succpred_stmt)
  => needs careful analysis. Handling in xform_switch_stmt is probably
     broken too, btw. Anyway, this is now done in src/ext/cfg.ml.
* Improve xform_switch_stmt (needless to eliminate inner loops)
* peepHole doesn't dive into CpcFun
  => I think one should lambda-lift CpcFun before using it anyway.
     It is used in src/frontc/cabs2cil.ml too, but there is no
     local functions at this stage.
[src/ext/...]
* Check and correct the rough support of cpc constructs
[src/ext/cfg.ml]
* Check local functions support.
  => look quite good, but who knows?
[src/ext/cpc.ml]
* in avoidAmpersand
  => what about arrays?
[src/ext/dataflow.ml]
* CpcConstructs do not contain instructions, but they contain
  expressions, should we ignore them too?
  => probably yes, just like if, switch, etc.
[src/frontc/cabs2cil.ml]
* check transformation of CPC_FUN (scoping, globals, etc.)
[src/check.ml]
* do the right thing with CpcFun (there is much more to save and restore
  than the few global references I deal with --- hashtables, startEnv(),
  etc.)
