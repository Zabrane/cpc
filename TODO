[src/frontc/cabs2cil.ml]
* Check stmtFallsThrough and stmtCanBreak (needs semantics analysis)
  => Goal: insert missing "return"
* Do not make a block for every cpc_spawn and cpc_fork
[src/cil.ml]
* Check indentation in pStmtKind (for CPC constructs)
  => should be quite good already.
* Handle CPC constructs in computeCFGInfo (function succpred_stmt)
  => needs careful analysis. Handling in xform_switch_stmt is probably
     broken too, btw.
* peepHole doesn't dive into CpcFun
  => I think one should lambda-lift CpcFun before using it anyway
[src/ext/...]
* Many not exhaustive pattern-matching...
