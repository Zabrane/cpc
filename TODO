* Do not make a block for every cpc_spawn
[src/cil.ml]
* Check indentation in pStmtKind (for CPC constructs)
  => should be quite good already.
* Handle CPC constructs in computeCFGInfo (function succpred_stmt)
  => needs careful analysis. Handling in xform_switch_stmt is probably
     broken too, btw. Anyway, this is now done in src/ext/cfg.ml.
* peepHole doesn't dive into CpcFun
  => I think one should lambda-lift CpcFun before using it anyway.
     It is used in src/frontc/cabs2cil.ml too, but there is not
     local functions at this stage.
[src/ext/...]
* Many not exhaustive pattern-matching...
[src/ext/cfg.ml]
* Check local functions support.
[src/ext/cpc.ml]
* Handle y = f(...) (when f is a cps function)
